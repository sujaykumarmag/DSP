Graph Networks


Complications
    1. Artibitary size
    2. No Spatial Locality (like grids)
    3. Multi-modality !?


Tasks in Graph Networks
    1. Node Classification - Traditional ML
    2. Link Prediction - Traditional ML
    3. subgraph prediction (community)
    4. New Generated Graph
    5. Graph level prediction - Traditional ML


2021 Statistics
 - 46% of peope ages 70-79 take more than 5 drugs  
 - Many patients take more than 20 drugs to treat Heart Disease, Depression, Insomnia





Topic 1  :  Graph data based for Traditional ML
ML needs features manually, so feature design is needed to (capture the relational structure of the Network)


Task 1 - Node level Prediction

Designing Node level Feature Engineering
    - Node Degree (Importance based features -> Is the node important !?)
    - Node Centrality (Importance based features -> Is the node important !?)
        1. Eigen-vector Centrality
        2. Between Centrality
        3. Closeness Centrality
    - Clustering Co-efficients (Signature based Features)
    - Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) (Signature based Features) 
        * Graphlets are rooted connected non-isomorphic subgraph






Task 2 - Link-level Prediction

Approaches 
1. Remove some random links and train an ML classifier to output the tuple of nodes (links)
2. Predict the links at G[t0, t0`] and compare it with G[t1, t1`] (this is for graph that evolves overtime)

Methodology : Predict a score c(x,y) for node x and node y

Designing Edge level Features
    - Distance based (shortest distance between 2 nodes)
    - Local Neighborhood Overlap
        1. Common Neighbors
        2. Jaccard co-efficients
        3. Adamic Adar Index
    - Global Neighborhood Overlap (prefer this, rest not needed)
        1. Katz Index 



Task 3 -  Graph-level Prediction

Approaches
1. Represent the features into an kernel and use kernelSVM for Classification (use Bag-of-nodefeatures)

Designing Graph level features 
    - k-step Graph Coloring Algorithm (Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel)




    







Note :
The way we assign links will determine the nature of the question we study

Disadvantages

1. version python control 
ERROR: Package 'chemicalx' requires a different Python: 3.10.12 not in '<=3.9,>=3.7'

2. version control (torchdrug)
TORCHDRUG_NODE_FEATURES = len(atom_default(Molecule.dummy_atom))
AttributeError: type object 'Molecule' has no attribute 'dummy_atom'. Did you mean: 'dummy_mol'?
